/// See *EdfaPgSaleResponse*
///
/// Payment Platform supports two main operation type: Single Message System (SMS) and Dual Message System (DMS).
/// SMS is represented by SALE transaction. It is used for authorization and capture at a time.
///
/// This operation is commonly used for immediate payments. DMS is represented by AUTH and CAPTURE transactions.
/// AUTH  is used for authorization only, without capture. This operation used to hold the funds on card account
/// (for example to check card validity). SALE request is used to make both SALE and AUTH transactions.
///
/// If you want to make AUTH transaction, you need to use parameter auth with value Y.
///
/// If you want to send a payment for the specific sub-account (channel), you need to use channel_id,
/// that specified in your Payment Platform account settings.
